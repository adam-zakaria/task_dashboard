# Design Decisions

## Frameworks, libraries, and tools
This project uses React (bootstrapped with Vite) and Tailwind CSS. 

### React
React is a very popular modern front end framework and is popular for a lot of reasons: tons of libraries, great templating language (JSX), modularity (components), performance, and a lot more. Because of its popularity, finding front end devs to work on React projects is very easy - there are a lot of React devs. 

### Vite
Vite and Create React App are two of the most popular ways to start and serve React project. Vite is *very* fast - when a change is made to the project Vite recompiles very quickly, a lot faster than CRA. 

### Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS is lauded by devs for making styling so much faster and more convenient. Tailwind provides utility classes which allow devs to inline CSS and not need to switch between markup and style files. 

## Task Details
Display one at a time or as many as we want. 


## Guidelines for good UI
* Draw the eye to important information when possible
* Hide information when possible

## How to display the task creation alongside the tasklist
* Separate submission form
* Always display the creation form
* Hideable creation form

## Frontend Framework: React

## Backend

## Styling: Material UI, Tailwind, Vanilla

# Work Breakdown: Development Phase
For the task management dashboard project, the development phase can be organized by components, with specific tasks for creating each component, integration, and code review. This breakdown will ensure a structured approach to developing the application. Note that this covers only the development phase; subsequent phases like testing, UI/UX evaluation, deployment, and maintenance are not included.

## Implement Task List Component
* Develop the component to display a list of tasks.
* Ensure it shows the task name, due date, and priority.
* Implement fetching and displaying data from the backend or state management system.

## Implement Task Details Component
* Develop a component to show detailed information about a task.
* This component should be displayed when a task in the Task List is clicked.
* Ensure it includes details like the task description, assignee, and status.

## Implement Task Creation Component
* Implement a form component for creating new tasks.
* Include necessary fields: task name, description, due date, and assignee.
* Add form validation to ensure data integrity.
Integration

## Integrate Components
* Ensure all components (Task List, Task Details, Task Creation Form) work together seamlessly.
* Implement state management to handle data flow across components.
* Test the integration in a development environment to ensure functionality.

## Conduct Code Review

* Perform code reviews for all developed components.
* Ensure coding standards, best practices, and project-specific guidelines are followed.
* Address and resolve any issues or feedback from the reviews.
